QUICK FIX FOR GITHUB ACTIONS:

1. Go to: Repository → Settings → Actions → General

2. Scroll to "Workflow permissions" section

3. CHANGE THIS:
   ❌ "Read repository contents and packages permissions" (current - read-only)
   
   TO THIS:
   ✅ "Read and write permissions"

4. CHECK THIS BOX:
   ✅ "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

5. Click "Save"

6. Go to Actions tab - workflow should now appear!

7. Go to Settings → Pages → Source → Select "GitHub Actions"

The workflow file is already on GitHub, you just need to enable write permissions!
